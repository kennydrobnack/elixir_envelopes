## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `elixir_envelopes` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:elixir_envelopes, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/elixir_envelopes](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir_envelopes).

## Update: this is a spike project

This is a spike at doing somewhat of a ledger-like (aka tracking finances in plain text files) I want to do something more like YNAB so will be following some principles from ledger-cli while not following the format it does.

NOTE: this is based on notes from this page: https://medium.com/blackode/writing-the-command-line-application-in-elixir-78a8d1b1850
